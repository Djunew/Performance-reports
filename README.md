# Employee performance reports 
### Autor: Angel Dzhunev

The application reads two json files which paths should be entered by the user.
Then, based on the employee information, a csv report is generated at the end.

Json input files:

- data file (contains information about the employees)
- report definition file (contains informations used to generate the report)
